# the-answer

The answer to the question of life, the universe and everything.


## Installation

```bash
npm install --save the-answer
```


## Usage

```js
const answer = require( 'the-answer' );
console.log( 'the answer is ' + answer );
```


## Really?

Yes â€” I needed a simple module to demonstrate how to import npm packages into Rollup bundles. In particular, this package exposes both a `main` (UMD format) and `module` (ES2015 format) in its package.json.
